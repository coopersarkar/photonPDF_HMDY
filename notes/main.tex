\begin{abstract}
  The calculation of electroweak corrections to LHC processes requires by consistency introducing
  a photon parton distributuon in the proton.
  %
  In this work we present a determination of the photon PDF from recent ATLAS measurements
  of high-mass Drell-Yan production at $\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV.
  %
  The analysis is performed in the {\tt xFitter} framework.
  %
  We compare our results with recent calculations of the photon PDF as well as with previous fits,
  finding good agreement within uncertainties.
