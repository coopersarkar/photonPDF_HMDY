\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

In this section we present the main results of this work, namely the determination
of the photon PDF $\gamma(x,Q^2)$ from a fit to the HERA structure functions
and ATLAS high-mass Drell-Yan cross-sections.

Using the NNLO fit settings discussed in Sect.~\ref{sec:fitsettings}, we find
a $\chi^{2}/N_{\rm dof} = 1.18$,
with a partial $\chi^2/N_{\rm dof} = 1.15$ for the high-mass Drell-yan data.
%
First of all we present our results for the photon PDF, and then the impact
of the DY measurements on the quark and gluon PDF.
%
In Fig.~\ref{photon_zoom} we show our results
for $\gamma(x,Q^2)$ for $Q^2=10^4$ GeV$^2$,
compared with LUXqed~\cite{Manohar:2016nzj}, HKR~\cite{Harland-Lang:2016apc}
and NNPDF3.0QED.
%
The comparison is restricted to the range $0.05 \le x \le 0.3$ corresponding
to the region where the fitted Drell-Yan measurements have direct kinematic sensitivity
to the photon PDF.
%
For NNPDF3.0QED, we show the 68\% CL uncertainty, while for LUXqed the uncertainty band
is obtained by adding in quadrature all the model variations.

From the results of Fig.~\ref{photon_zoom} we find that in the region where the HMDY data is
sensitive to the photon PDF, there is good agreement between the four determinations.
%
As compared to NNPDF3.0QED, the PDF uncertainties in the current analysis are reduced, though
they are still not competitive with those of LUXqed.
%
We also note the excellent agreement between the LUXqed and the HKN determinations.

We now turn the comparison to the quark and gluon PDFs.
%
Here we will compare a reference fit with the same settings as in Sect.~\ref{sec:fitsettings}
but with only the HERA inclusive structure function data with the results of this work,
which also include the ATLAS high-mass DY measurements.
%
We do not attempt to compare as well with the global fits, since our motivation here is only to
gauge the impact on quarks and gluons of the high-mass Drell-Yan data.

Fig.~\ref{PDF_7.5GeV}
shows the PDF distributions $x_{u_v},xd_{d_v},x\bar{u}, x\bar{d}, xg$ at $Q^{2}$ = 7.5$^{2}$ GeV$^{2}$,
with the MC experimental uncertainties

After this comparison at the level of PDFs, we move to a comparison between the theoretical
predictions and the high-mass Drell-Yan measurements.
%
In Fig.~\ref{hmDY_2D} we show the
comparison between the ATLAS high-mass Drell Yan data and the NNLO fit predictions
for the first bin of the $(y_{ll},m_{ll})$ distribution.
%
In the lower panel we shows the ratio of theory over data, where the yellow band
  corresponds to the correlated systematic uncertainties.

The values of the $\chi^2$ for the HERA data and for
the high-mass DY data for the NNLO fit
are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:chi2fit}.
%
As can be seen, the agreement between data and the NNLO theory
is very good for all the $m_{ll}$ of the 8 TeV Drell-Yan data.
%
For the sum of all the five rapidity bins, we find a $\chi^2=55$
for 48 data points.
%
The quality of the agreement with the HERA inclusive structure functions
is similarly good.

Check the effect of the various variations on the photon PDF, but separately variation per variation,
showing the most important ones, and not stacking the error into a common error band


An important cross-check of the robustness of the estimated uncertainty for the photon
PDF in this analysis is provided by the comparison of the Monte Carlo method
with the Hessian method.
%
In Fig.~\ref{fig:photon_mc_vs_hessian} we show this comparison,
which indicates a reasonable agreement between the two methods.
%
In particular, the central values of the photon obtained with the two fitting
techniques are quite similar to each other.

  uncertainties. {\bf remove all other bands, update labels.}

Another interesting question that our analysis allows addressing is what is
the impact of the high-mass Drell-Yan 8 TeV measurements on the quark and gluon
PDFs.
