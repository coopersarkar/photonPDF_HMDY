\section{Results}

\subsection{Sensitivity}
 show impact of HM DY on PDFs using sensitivity studies based on
pseudo-data, for which we only use the data uncertainties, while central 
value are fixed:
 HERA I+II vs HERA I+II + HMDY --> see the sensitivity plots from the previous email


conclusion: HMDY data has a large impact on photonPDF 

\subsection{Reweighting}

proceed to reweighting of the global photon PDFs : $NNPDF3.0\_nnlo\_qed$

-->  see the reweighting plots (select only the NNPDF3.0nnlo qed from the previous email)

perhaps add a chi2 table for various global PDF sets on the market to check the 
agreement between HMDY data and predictions: CT14qed, NNPDF3.0qed, LUXqed...

conclusion: HMDY can considerably reduce the uncertainties on photonPDF for global PDFs

\subsection{Fits}

--> extract PDFs using HMDY +HERA data? and plot it in comparison with global QED PDF sets (reweighetd)?
