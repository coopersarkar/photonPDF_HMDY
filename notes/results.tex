\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

In this section we present the main results of this work, namely the
determination of the photon PDF $x\gamma(x,Q)$ from a fit to the
HERA structure functions and ATLAS high-mass Drell-Yan cross sections.
%
First of all, we show the resulting photon PDF and compare with other
recent extractions.
%
We also quantify the impact of the High-Mass Drell-Yan (HMDY) data on
the quark and gluon PDFs.
%
Then we check for robustness of the results by varying the model, parametrization, and procedural
inputs that affect our fit of $\gamma(x,Q)$.
%
Finally, we discuss the perturbative stability by comparing NLO and
NNLO results.

\subsection{Comparison between high-mass DY data and fit results}

In the following, we present results obtained using the
double-differential $\lp m_{ll},y_{ll}\rp$ distributions, though we
have verified that compatible results are obtained if the
$\lp m_{ll},\Delta\eta_{ll}\rp$ ones are fitted instead.
%
Using the NNLO fit settings discussed in Sect.~\ref{sec:fitsettings},
we find a $\chi^{2}/N_{\rm dof} = 1235.85/1056$, with a partial
$\chi^2/N_{\rm data} = 47.96/48$ for the high-mass Drell-Yan data,
where $N_{\rm dof}$ is the number of degree of freedom in the fit and 
$N_{\rm data}$  is the number of data points for high-mass DY data.

Fig.~\ref{hmDY_2D} shows the comparison between the ATLAS
high-mass Drell Yan data and the NNLO predictions for two
representative bins of the $(y_{ll},m_{ll})$ distribution, in
particular the first and fourth bins.
%
We denote as {\tt xFitter\_epHMDY} the fit results.
%
In the lower panel we show the ratio of theory over data, where the
yellow band corresponds to the correlated systematic uncertainties.
%
The band around the theory prediction corresponds to the total theory
uncertainty from the PDF fit. 
%
The shifts due to systematic uncertainties are indicated by a dashed
line.

\end{figure}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

As can be seen from Fig.~\ref{hmDY_2D}, once the shifts due to
experimental systematic uncertainties have been accounted for, there
is a reasonable agreement between ATLAS data and NNLO theory
predictions.
%
This agreement is consistent the values of the $\chi^2$ reported in
Table~\ref{tab:chi2fit} and extends to the other $m_{ll}$ bins.
%
We emphasise the high precision of this measurement with experimental
errors at the few percent level in most of the kinematic range
available.


\subsection{The photon PDF from high-mass DY data}
%
We present our results for the photon PDF and then the impact
of the DY measurements on the quark and gluon PDFs.
%

In Fig.~\ref{photon_zoom} we show  the $x\gamma(x,Q)$ distribution at
$Q^2=10^4$ GeV$^2$ with experimental uncertainty band using MC method and it is compared to LUXqed~\cite{Manohar:2016nzj},
HKR~\cite{Harland-Lang:2016apc} and NNPDF3.0QED sets.
%
The comparison is restricted to the range $0.02 \le x \le 0.8$,
corresponding to the region where the fitted Drell-Yan measurements
have direct kinematic sensitivity on the photon PDF.
%
For NNPDF3.0QED, we show the 68\% CL uncertainty, while for LUXqed the
uncertainty band is obtained by adding in quadrature all the model
variations.

  Right: the same comparison now with the results normalized to the central value
  of {\tt xFitter\_epHMDY}.
  %
  For HKR16, only the central value is shown, while LUXqed includes

  of~\cite{Manohar:2016nzj} }
\label{photon_zoom} \label{photon_zoom_ratio}
\end{figure}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

From the results of Fig.~\ref{photon_zoom} we find that in the region
where the HMDY predictions are sensitive to the photon PDF, there is
good agreement between the four determinations.
%
As compared to NNPDF3.0QED, the PDF uncertainties in the current
analysis are reduced, though they are still not competitive with those
of LUXqed.
%
We also note the excellent agreement between the LUXqed and the HKN
calculations, illustrating the commonalities between the two
approaches.

Next, in Fig.~\ref{photon_zoom_ratio} we show the same comparison of
different results for the photon PDF $x\gamma(x,Q)$ now normalized to
the central value of {\tt xFitter\_epHMDY}.
%
This format allows us to better assess the relative compatibility
between the various results, as well as the relative size of the PDF
uncertainties.
%
We observe that the experimental uncertainty on {\tt xFitter\_epHMDY}
is at the $\sim 30\%$ level, depending on the specific value of $x$,
improving over NNPDF3.0QED but still far from the percent accuracy of
the LUXqed calculation.

Another interesting question that our analysis allows us to address is
what is the impact of the high-mass Drell-Yan 8 TeV measurements on
the light quark PDFs.
%
For this purpose, and since HERA data alone (which should be used as
benchmark for this comparison) does not have sensitivity on the photon
PDF, we have repeated our fits this time freezing the photon PDF to the
shape given by HMDY data.
%
This way, we can perform a meaningful comparison between the HERA-only
baseline and the HERA+HMDY fit to gauge the modifications of quark and
gluon PDFs.
%
This comparison is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:QCDfit} for the up and down
antiquarks, for which the effect of the high-mass Drell-Yan data is
expected to be more pronounced. PDFs are presented as ratios to the
central value of the HERA+HMDY fit with their experimental uncertainties.
%
As is apparent from this comparison, the modifications in the medium
and large-$x$ antiquark distributions from the HMDY data are
significant for $x\ge 0.01$, though the two fits agree always at the
one-sigma level.
%
Particularly for the case of $x\bar{d}$, the improvement of the PDF
uncertainties is also marked.
%
The results were also cross-checked with the fits obtained switching
off the QED effects for both HERA only fits and the nominal fits, with
the same outcome.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

After this comparison at the level of PDFs, we move to a comparison
between theoretical predictions and high-mass Drell-Yan measurements.
%
The values of the $\chi^2$ for the HERA structure functions and for
the high-mass DY data for the NNLO fit are summarised in
Table~\ref{tab:chi2fit}.
%
As can be seen, the agreement between data and NNLO predictions is
very good for all the bins in $m_{ll}$ of the $8$ TeV Drell-Yan data.
%
For the sum of all the five rapidity bins, we find a $\chi^2=48$ for
$48$ data points.
%
The quality of the agreement with the HERA inclusive structure
functions is similarly good.
%
In the calculation of the total $\chi^2$, the correlations between the
different $m_{ll}$ bins have been taken into account.

Following this presentation of the main features of the {\tt
  xFitter\_epHMDY} analysis, we now turn to discuss its stability and
to assess the model, parametrization, and procedural uncertainties.

%\subsection{Model, parametrization, and procedural uncertainties}
\subsection{Robustness and perturbative stability checks}

In this section we explore the robustness of our determination of the
photon PDF $x\gamma(x,Q)$ upon a number of variations of the values of
physical parameters, like $\alpha_s$ or the charm mass, and the
choices made for the PDF parametrization, and estimate the
variations associated to the different fitting procedure adopted.
%
We perform one variation at a time and compare the effect on the
central value of the photon PDF with the size of its experimental
uncertainty computed using the Monte-Carlo method.

We start considering the impact of uncertainties associated to either
the choice of some physical parameters or of some specific settings
adopted in the fit.
%
In Fig.~\ref{fig:model} we show the comparison between the baseline
determination of $x\gamma(x,Q)$ at $Q^2=10^4$ GeV$^2$ in the present
analysis (including the experimental uncertainties) with the central
value of those fits for which a number of variations has been
performed.
%
In particular, we have considered the following variations:
\begin{itemize}
\item The strong coupling constant is varied by $\delta \alpha_s=\pm 0.002$ around the central value.
\item The ratio of strangeness to non-strange PDFs is decreased to $r_s=0.75$ instead of $r_s=1$.
\item The value of the charm mass is varied between $m_c=1.41$ GeV and $m_c=1.53$ GeV,
  and that of the bottom mass between $m_b=4.25$ GeV and $m_b=4.75$ GeV.
\item The minimum value $Q_{\rm cut}$ of the fitted data is decreased down to $\sqrt{5}$ GeV.
\item The parametrization scale $Q_0$ is raised to $\sqrt{10}$ GeV as compared
  to the baseline value of $Q_0=\sqrt{7.5}~$GeV.
\end{itemize}
The results of Fig.~\ref{fig:model} show that in all cases the effect
of this variations is contained (and typically much smaller) within
the experimental PDF uncertainty bands of the reference fit.

\label{fig:model}
\end{figure}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Another important check of the robustness of our determination of
$x\gamma$ can be obtained by comparing the baseline fit with further
fits where a number of new free parameters are allowed in the PDF
parametrization, in addition to those listed in Eq.~(\ref{eq:param}).
%
In Fig.~\ref{fig:param} we show the impact of three representative
variations (others have been explored, leading to smaller
differences): more flexibility to the gluon distribution, allowing it
to become negative at the initial scale (labeled by ${\rm neg}$), adding on top $D_{u_v}$,
and then $D_{\bar{u}}+D_{\bar{d}}$.
%
As above, all variations are contained within the MC PDF uncertainty
bands, though the impact of the parametrization variations is larger
than that of the model ones: in the case of the
${\rm nefg}+D_{\bar{u}}+D_{\bar{d}}$ variations, the central value is
at the edge of the lower uncertainty band.
%
Importantly, once this additional uncertainty coming from the
parametrization variations is accounted for, the agreement of our fit
with LUXqed and HKR16 improves in the region around $x\simeq 0.02$.

An important cross-check of the robustness of the estimated
uncertainty of the photon PDF in this analysis is provided by the
comparison of the Monte-Carlo method with the Hessian method.
%
In Fig.~\ref{fig:photon_mc_vs_hessian} we show this comparison, which
indicates a reasonable agreement between the two methods.
%
In particular, the central values of the photon obtained with the two
fitting techniques are quite similar to each other.

%\subsection{Perturbative stability of $x\gamma(x,Q^2)$}

An interesting exercise is to quantify the perturbative stability of
our fit of the photon PDF $x\gamma(x,Q)$ with respect to the inclusion
of NNLO QCD corrections in the analysis.
%
To study this point, in Fig.~\ref{fig:nlo_vs_nnlo} we show a
comparison between our baseline fit of $x\gamma(x,Q)$, based on NNLO
QCD + NLO QED theory, with the central value resulting from a fit
based instead on NLO QCD theory (with the QED part identical in both
cases).
%
For the NNLO fit, only the experimental PDF uncertainties, estimated
using the Monte-Carlo method, are shown.

From the comparison of Fig.~\ref{fig:nlo_vs_nnlo}, we find that our
fit of $x\gamma(x,Q)$ exhibits a reasonable perturbative stability,
since the central value of the NLO fit is always contained in the
one-sigma PDF uncertainty band of our baseline determination based on
NNLO QCD + NLO QED.
%
The agreement between the two fits is particularly good for
$x\gsim 0.1$, where the two central values are very close to each
other.
