\subsection{Sensitivity}
 show impact of HM DY on PDFs using sensitivity studies based on
pseudo-data, for which we only use the data uncertainties, while central 
value are fixed:
 HERA I+II vs HERA I+II + HMDY --> see the sensitivity plots from the previous email


conclusion: HMDY data has a large impact on photonPDF 



\subsection{PDF Fits}

In order to make a full PDF fit the  ATLAS Drell-Yan data data are fitted together with the final combined inclusive 
cross section data from HERA~\cite{hera}. The HERA data provide information on the quark/antiquark and gluon content of 
the proton and the Drell-Yan data add information on the photon content of the proton. 
The NLO and NNLO pQCD predictions are fitted to the data using the xFitter open source pQCD fitting platform~\cite{xFitter}.
The DGLAP equations~\cite{dglap} are solved using the programme QCDNUM which has been modified to include 
the photon PDF in the proton~\cite{qcdnum}.
The DGLAP equations yield the PDFs at all scales if they are input as finctions of $x$ at a starting scale $Q^2_0$, which 
should be large enough that perturbative QCD can be assumed to be valid. For the present analysis this value is chosen
to be $Q^2_0 = 7.5~$GeV$^2$. This is also the value chosen for the minimum value of $Q^2$ for data entering the fit.
The charm and beauty masses are chosen to be $m_c=1.47~$GeV and $m_b=4.5~$GeV following the HERA analysis. 
The value of $\alpha_s(M_Z)$ is chosen to be $\alpha_s(M_Z)=0.118$~\cite{PDG}. 
The value of $Q^2_0$ is above the charm mass squared, however a version of the programme 
is used which displaces the charm threshold from the charm mass~\cite{charmthresh} such that the threshold is at $Q^2_0$.
The form of the $\chi^2$ used for the fit is that defined in the H1 paper~\cite{h1chisqdef}. 
Alternative forms have also been tried with no significant difference to our results.
 
The PDF parametrisation input at $Q^2_0$ is determined by the technique of saturation of the $\chi^{2}$~\cite{h1chisqsat}.
The parametrised PDFs are the valence distributions $xu_{v}$ and $xd_{v}$, the gluon distribution $xg$, and the \textit{u}-type and \textit{d}-type sea, $x\bar{U}$, $x\bar{D}$, where $x\bar{U} = x\bar{u}$ and $x\bar{D} = x\bar{d} + x\bar{s}$, and finally the photon distribution $x\gamma$. The following standard functional form is used to parametrise them:
\begin{equation}
xf(x) = Ax^{B}(1-x)^{C}(1+Dx+Ex^{2})
\end{equation}
where the normalisation parameters $A_{u_{v}}$, $A_{d_{v}}$ and $A_{g}$ are constrained by the number sum-rules and the 
momentum sum-rule, respectively. The \textit{B} parameters $B_{\bar{U}}$ and $B_{\bar{D}}$ are set equal, such that there 
is a single \textit{B} parameter for the sea distribution. The data are not sensitive to the 
strangeness content of the proton which is thus set such that $x\bar{s} = 0.5\bar{D}$, following the ATLAS 
analysis~\cite{atlasstrange}. The further constraint $A_{\bar{U}} = 0.5 A_{\bar{D}}$ is imposed such that $\bar{u}=x\bar{d}$ as $x \to 0$.
The \textit{D} and \textit{E} parameters are introduced one by one until no significant 
improvement in $\chi^{2}$ is found. 

 For the NNLO fit a $\chi^{2}/ndf = 1.18$, with a partial $\chi^2/ndp = 1.15$ for the high-mass Drell-yan data [{\it update with final numbers}], is achieved for the following parametrisation, which has 11 parameters for the quarks and gluons and 5 parameters for the photon:
\begin{eqnarray}
xu_v(x) = A_{u_v}x^{B_{u_v}}(1-x)^{C_{u_v}}(1+E_{u_v}x^{2}), \\
xd_v(x) = A_{d_v}x^{B_{d_v}}(1-x)^{C_{d_v}}, \\
x\bar{U}(x) = A_{\bar{U}}x^{B_{\bar{U}}}(1-x)^{C_{\bar{U}}}, \\
x\bar{D}(x) = A_{\bar{D}}x^{B_{\bar{D}}}(1-x)^{C_{\bar{D}}}, \\
xg(x) = A_{g}x^{B_{g}}(1-x)^{C_{g}}(1+E_{g}x^{2}), \\
x\gamma(x) = A_{\gamma}x^{B_{\gamma}}(1-x)^{C_{\gamma}}(1+D_{\gamma}x+E_{\gamma}x^{2}) \\
\end{eqnarray}
The parametrisation for HERA data differs from that of the HERAPDF2.0 PDF since the starting scale $Q^2_0$ is higher and the additional negative term in the gluon parametrisation is not necessary.
Parametrisation and model uncertainties are considered according to the HERAPDF 
procedure~\cite{hera} 
by adding extra terms which make little difference to the $\chi^2$ of the fit, but which can change the shape of the PDFs. Additonal parameters considered are: the extra negative term for the gluon; $D_{u_v}$, $D_{\bar{u}}$ and $E_{\bar{d}}$. Model variations considered are the variation of: 
$m_b$ from 4.25 to 4.75 GeV; $m_c$ from 1.41 to 1.53 GeV;  $Q_0^2$ up to 10 GeV$^2$; 
$Q_{cut}^2$ up to 10 GeV$^2$; the strangeness fraction down to $f_s=0.4$; the value of $\alpha_s(M_Z)$ from 0.116 to 0.120.

Fig.~\ref{PDF_7.5GeV}
 shows the PDF distributions $x_{u_v},xd_{d_v},x\bar{u}, x\bar{d}, xg$ at $Q^{2}$ = 7.5$^{2}$ GeV$^{2}$,
including model and parametrisation uncertainties, while  Fig.~\ref{PDF_10000GeV} 
shows them at $Q^{2}$ = 10$^{4}$ GeV$^{2}$. {\it Add model and parametrisation variations, Use NNLO MC central}.

In these figures comparisons are made to the NNPDF3.0PDF set and the HERAPDF2.0 set.
The shape of the $xd_{u_v}$ distribution is close to that of HERAPDF2.0 
because of the dominance of HERA data in the fit.

the predictions.

The NNLO photon PDF distribution is shown 
both at the starting scale (7.5 GeV$^{2}$) and at 10$^{4}$ GeV$^{2}$ 
 in Fig.~\ref{photon}, where it is also compared to an NLO extraction of the photon distribution.
The $x$-range of the figure is restricted to the range of sensitivity of the high-mass drell-Yan data;
$0.045 < x < 0.35$. The NLO and NNLO photon PDFs are compatible over this range.

\end{figure}

Fig.~\ref{photon_zoom} 
shows the photon distribution in the restricted range compared to the NNPDF3.0qed NNLO photon PDF.
The uncertainties are considerably reduced. The comparison is shown at scale 100 GeV$^{2}$ and 
at 10$^{4}$ GeV$^{2}$, where the value of 100 GeV$^{2}$ is chosen such that comparisons can also be 
made to the LUXqed~\cite{luxqed} photon PDF, which is only defined above this scale.  The 
HKR photon PDF~\cite{hkr} is also shown in this figure. The fit predictions from the present analysis
agree  with the LUXqed and the HKR photon PDFs at the 1-$\sigma$ level.
