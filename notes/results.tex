\subsection{Sensitivity}
 show impact of HM DY on PDFs using sensitivity studies based on
pseudo-data, for which we only use the data uncertainties, while central 
value are fixed:
 HERA I+II vs HERA I+II + HMDY --> see the sensitivity plots from the previous email


conclusion: HMDY data has a large impact on photonPDF 

\subsection{The photon PDF}

For the NNLO fit a $\chi^{2}/ndf = 1.18$, with a partial $\chi^2/ndp = 1.15$ for the high-mass Drell-yan data [{\it update with final numbers}], is achieved for the
parametrization described in the previous section.

Fig.~\ref{PDF_7.5GeV}
 shows the PDF distributions $x_{u_v},xd_{d_v},x\bar{u}, x\bar{d}, xg$ at $Q^{2}$ = 7.5$^{2}$ GeV$^{2}$,
including model and parametrisation uncertainties, while  Fig.~\ref{PDF_10000GeV} 
shows them at $Q^{2}$ = 10$^{4}$ GeV$^{2}$. {\it Add model and parametrisation variations, Use NNLO MC central}.

In these figures comparisons are made to the NNPDF3.0PDF set and the HERAPDF2.0 set.
The shape of the $xd_{u_v}$ distribution is close to that of HERAPDF2.0 
because of the dominance of HERA data in the fit. 


Fig.~\ref{hmDY_2D} 
shows the comparison between the high-mass Drell-Yan double differential distribution and 
the predictions.

The $\chi^{2}$ values for the high-mass Drell Yan data and the output parameters from NNLO fit can be found in Table.~\ref{chi2_scan} 
and Table.~\ref{par_scan} 
respectively.

The NNLO photon PDF distribution is shown 
both at the starting scale (7.5 GeV$^{2}$) and at 10$^{4}$ GeV$^{2}$ 
 in Fig.~\ref{photon}, where it is also compared to an NLO extraction of the photon distribution.
The $x$-range of the figure is restricted to the range of sensitivity of the high-mass drell-Yan data;
$0.045 < x < 0.35$. The NLO and NNLO photon PDFs are compatible over this range.

\end{figure}

Fig.~\ref{photon_zoom} 
shows the photon distribution in the restricted range compared to the NNPDF3.0qed NNLO photon PDF.
The uncertainties are considerably reduced. The comparison is shown at scale 100 GeV$^{2}$ and 
at 10$^{4}$ GeV$^{2}$, where the value of 100 GeV$^{2}$ is chosen such that comparisons can also be 
made to the LUXqed~\cite{luxqed} photon PDF, which is only defined above this scale.  The 
HKR photon PDF~\cite{hkr} is also shown in this figure. The fit predictions from the present analysis
agree  with the LUXqed and the HKR photon PDFs at the 1-$\sigma$ level.
