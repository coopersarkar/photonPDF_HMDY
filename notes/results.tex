\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

In this section we present the main results of this work,
namely the determination
of the photon PDF $\gamma(x,Q^2)$ from a fit to the HERA structure functions
and ATLAS high-mass Drell-Yan cross-sections.
%
First of all, we show the resulting photon PDF and compare with
with other recent extractions.
%
We also quantify the impact of the hmDY data on the quark and
gluon PDFs.
%
Then we assess the model, parametrization
and procedural uncertainties that affect our fit of $\gamma(x,Q^2)$.
%
Finally, we discuss the perturbative stability by comparing
NLO and NNLO results.

\subsection{The photon PDF from high-mass DY data}

In the following, we will present results obtained using the
double-differential $\lp m_{ll},y_{ll}\rp$ distributions, though
we have verified that compatible results
are obtained if the $\lp m_{ll},\Delta\eta_{ll}\rp$ ones are fitted
instead.
%
Using the NNLO fit settings discussed in Sect.~\ref{sec:fitsettings}, we find
a $\chi^{2}/N_{\rm dof} = 1.18$,
with a partial $\chi^2/N_{\rm dof} = 1.15$ for the high-mass Drell-yan data.
%
First of all we present our results for the photon PDF, and then the impact
of the DY measurements on the quark and gluon PDF.
%
We will denote as {\tt xFitter\_epHMDY} the results of this work.

In Fig.~\ref{photon_zoom} we show our results
for $\gamma(x,Q^2)$ for $Q^2=10^4$ GeV$^2$,
compared with LUXqed~\cite{Manohar:2016nzj}, HKR~\cite{Harland-Lang:2016apc}
and NNPDF3.0QED.
%
The comparison is restricted to the range $0.05 \le x \le 0.3$ corresponding
to the region where the fitted Drell-Yan measurements have direct kinematic sensitivity
to the photon PDF.
%
For NNPDF3.0QED, we show the 68\% CL uncertainty, while for LUXqed the uncertainty band
is obtained by adding in quadrature all the model variations.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

From the results of Fig.~\ref{photon_zoom} we find that in the region where the HMDY data is
sensitive to the photon PDF, there is good agreement between the four determinations.
%
As compared to NNPDF3.0QED, the PDF uncertainties in the current analysis are reduced, though
they are still not competitive with those of LUXqed.
%
We also note the excellent agreement between the LUXqed and the HKN calculations,
illustrating the commonalities between the two approaches.

Next in Fig.~\ref{photon_zoom_ratio} we show the same comparison of different
results for the photon PDF $x\gamma(x,Q^2)$ now normalized to the central value of {\tt xFitter\_hmDY}.
%
This format allows better to compare the relative compatibility between the various results,
as well as the relative size of the PDF uncertainties in each case.
%
We observe that the experimental uncertainty on {\tt xFitter\_hmDY} is at the $\sim 30\%$ level,
depending on the specific value of $x$, improving over NNPDF3.0QED but still far from the
percent accuracy of the LUXqed calculation.


Another interesting question that our analysis allows addressing is what is
the impact of the high-mass Drell-Yan 8 TeV measurements on the quark and gluon
PDFs.
%
For this purpose, and since HERA data alone (which should be used as benchmark for
this comparison) does not have sensitivity to the photon PDF,
we have repeated our fits this time switching off QED effects and thus setting to zero
the photon PDF.
%
This way, we can perform a meaningful comparison between the HERA-only baseline and the
HERA+hmDY fit to gauge the modifications of quark and gluon PDFs.

This comparison is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:QCDfit} for the up and down antiquarks,
for which the effect of the high-mass
Drell-Yan data is expected to be more marked, and the PDFs are presented
as ratio to the central value of the HERA+hmDY fit.
%
As is apparent from this comparison, the modifications in the medium and large-$x$
antiquarks from the hmDY data are significant for $x\ge 0.01$, though the two fits
agree always at the one-sigma level.
%
Specially for the case of $x\bar{d}$, the improvement in PDF uncertainties
is also marked.

After this comparison at the level of PDFs, we move to a comparison between the theoretical
predictions and the high-mass Drell-Yan measurements.
%
First of all, the values of the $\chi^2$ for the HERA structure functions
and for the high-mass DY data for the NNLO fit
are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:chi2fit}.
%
As can be seen, the agreement between data and the NNLO theory
is very good for all the $m_{ll}$ of the 8 TeV Drell-Yan data.
%
For the sum of all the five rapidity bins, we find a $\chi^2=55$
for 48 data points.
%
The quality of the agreement with the HERA inclusive structure functions
is similarly good.
%
In the calculation of the total $\chi^2$, the correlations between the different
$m_{ll}$ bins have been taken into account.

Next, in Fig.~\ref{hmDY_2D} we show the
comparison between the ATLAS high-mass Drell Yan data and the NNLO fit predictions
for the  two representative bins of of the $(y_{ll},m_{ll})$ distribution,
  in particular the first and fourth bins.
%
In the lower panel we shows the ratio of theory over data, where the yellow band
corresponds to the correlated systematic uncertainties.
%
The band around the theory prediction corresponds to the total
theory uncertainty from the PDF fit.
%
The shifts due to systematic uncertainties are indicated by a dashed line.

\label{hmDY_2D}
\end{figure}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

As we can see from Fig.~\ref{hmDY_2D}, once the shifts due to experimental systematic
uncertainties have been accounted for, there is a reasonable agreement
between the ATLAS data and the NNLO theory predictions.
%
This agreement is consistent the values of the $\chi^2$ reported in
Table~\ref{tab:chi2fit}, and extends for other $m_{ll}$ bins.
%
We emphasize the high precision of this measurement, with experimental
errors at the few percent level in most of the kinematical range available.

Following this presentation of the main features of this
{\tt xFitter\_hmDY} analysis, now we turn to discuss its stability
and study the impact of a number of model, parametrization,
and procedural uncertainties.

\subsection{Model, parametrization, and procedural uncertainties}

In this section we explore the robustness of our determination of
the photon PDF $x\gamma(x,Q^2)$ upon a number of variations
in the values of physical parameters like $\alpha_s$ or the charm mass,
the choices made for the PDFs parametrization and the uncertainties
associated to the fitting procedure adopted.
%
In each case, we will perform one variation at a time and compare the effect on
the central value of the photon PDF with the size of its experimental uncertainty
computed, as explained above, using the Monte Carlo method.

First of all we consider the impact  of uncertainties associated to either the choice
of some physical parameters or of some specific settings adopted in the fit.
%
In Fig.~\ref{fig:model} we show the comparison between the baseline determination of
  $x\gamma(x,Q^2)$ at $Q^2=10^4$ GeV$^2$ in the present
analysis (including the experimental uncertainties)
with the central value of those  fits for which a number of variations has been performed.
%
In particular, we have considered the following variations:
\begin{itemize}
\item The strong coupling constant is varied by $\delta \alpha_s=\pm 0.002$ around the PDG value.
\item The ratio of strangeness to non-strange PDFs is decreased to $r_s=0.75$ instead of $r_s=1$.
\item The value of the charm pole mass is varied between $m_c=1.41$ GeV to $m_c=1.53$ GeV,
  and that of the bottom pole mass from $m_b=4.25$ GeV to $m_b=4.75$ GeV.
\item The minimum value $Q^2_{\rm cut}$ of the fitted data is decreased down to 5 GeV$^2$.
\item The input parametrization scale $Q_0^2$ is raised to 10 GeV$^2$ as compared
  to the baseline value of $Q_0^2=7.5~$GeV$^2$.
\end{itemize}
The results of Fig.~\ref{fig:model} show that in all cases the effect of this variations
is contained (and is typically much smaller) within the experimental PDF
uncertainty bands of the reference fit.

 The following variations have been considered: $r_s$, $Q^2_{\rm cut}$, $\alpha_s$ (left plot) and
$m_c$, $m_b$, $Q_0^2$ (right plot), see text for more details.

\label{fig:model}
\end{figure}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Another important check of the robustness of our determination of $x\gamma$ can be
obtained by comparing the baseline with the results of further
  fits where a number of new free parameters are allowed
  in the PDF parametrization, in addition to those listed in Eq.~(\ref{eq:param}).
  %
  In Fig.~\ref{fig:param} we show the impact of three representative variations
  (others have been explored, leading to smaller differences):
  more flexibility to the gluon distribution, allowing
  it to become negative (labeled by ${\rm neg}$), adding on top $D_{u_v}$, and then $D_{\bar{u}}+D_{\bar{d}}$.
  %
  As above, all variations are contained within the MC PDF uncertainty bands, though the
  impact of the parametrization variations is larger than that of the model ones:
  in the case of the ${\rm nefg}+D_{\bar{u}}+D_{\bar{d}}$ variations, the central value
  is at the edge of the lower uncertainty band.
  %
  Importantly, once these additional uncertainty coming from parametrization
  variations is accounted for, the agreement of our fit with LUXqed and HKR16 improves
  in the region around $x\simeq 0.02$.


An important cross-check of the robustness of the estimated uncertainty for the photon
PDF in this analysis is provided by the comparison of the Monte Carlo method
with the Hessian method.
%
In Fig.~\ref{fig:photon_mc_vs_hessian} we show this comparison,
which indicates a reasonable agreement between the two methods.
%
In particular, the central values of the photon obtained with the two fitting
techniques are quite similar to each other.

  In particular, the parametrization variations that have been explored
  are: more flexibility to the gluon distribution, allowing

  uncertainties.

\subsection{Perturbative stability of $x\gamma(x,Q^2)$}

An interesting exercise
is to quantify the perturbative stability
of our fit of the photon PDF $x\gamma(x,Q^2)$ with respect
to the inclusion or not of NNLO QCD corrections in the analysis.
%
To study this point, in Fig.~\ref{fig:nlo_vs_nnlo} we show
a comparison between our baseline
fit of $x\gamma(x,Q^2)$, based on NNLO QCD + NLO QED theory,
with the central value resulting from a fit based instead on
NLO QCD theory (with the QED part identical in both cases).
%
For the NNLO fit, only the experimental PDF
  uncertainties, estimated using the Monte Carlo method, are shown.

  From the comparison of Fig.~\ref{fig:nlo_vs_nnlo}, we find that
  the our fit of $x\gamma(x,Q^2)$ exhibits a reasonable
  perturbative stability, since the central value of the
  NLO fit is always contained in the one-sigma PDF
  uncertainty bad of our baseline determination based
  on NNLO QCD + NLO QED.
  %
  The agreement between the two fits is particularly good
  for $x\gsim 0.1$, where the two central values are
  very close to each other.
