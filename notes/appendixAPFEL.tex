\section{NLO QED corrections in APFEL}
\label{sec:appendixAPFEL}

In this appendix we provide a detailed description of
the implementation and validation of NLO QED corrections
in {\tt APFEL}.
%
These can be separated into two main developments: first of all,
the implementation of NLO corrections in the QED coupling
$\alpha$ to the PDF evolution via the DGLAP evolution
equations; secondly, the implementation of NLO QED coefficient
functions for deep-inelastic structure functions.
%
We now discuss these two improvements in turn.
