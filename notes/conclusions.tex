\section{Conclusions}

\label{sec:conclusions}

The determination of the photon content of the proton has
attracted a considerable amount of attention recently, motivated by
its potentially large impact for precision physics at the LHC.
%
In this work, we have presented a determination of the photon PDF from
a fit based on HERA inclusive structure functions together with
recent ATLAS measurements
of high-mass Drell-Yan cross-sections by means of the
{\tt xFitter} framework.
%
We find that, as hinted by a previous reweighting
analysis, these high-mass DY data provides significant constraints on the photon PDF
in the region $0.05 \le x \le 0.3$, where the data has direct
sensitivity.
%
The resulting uncertainties on the gluon are still substantial,
between 20\%-40\%, though clearly smaller than those of the
NNPDF3.0QED analysis (based on older LHC Drell-Yan measurements).

Our results are in agreement within uncertainties with two
recent calculations of the photon PDF,
LUXqed and HKR, for the region of $x$ where the DY data has sensitivity.
%
On the other hand, we also find that a direct determination of the photon PDF
is still far from being competitive with the LUXqed and HKR calculations,
which are based in the input from the
precision measurements of inclusive structure function of the proton.
%
This analysis however provides further evidence that the information
on the photon PDF provided by different pieces of experimental data
is overall consistent.

The results of this study have been made possible by a number of technical developments
that should be of direct application for future PDF fits accounting for QED corrections.
%
These developments include  in particular
the implementation of $\mathcal{O}\lp \alpha^2\rp$ corrections to the DGLAP
evolution equations
and the DIS coefficient functions in {\tt APFEL}.
%
Moreover, our results further
illustrate the flexibility of the {\tt xFitter} toolbox to extend
its capabilities from the standard quark and gluon PDF fits.
%
Finally, the possibility to extend
{\tt aMCfast}/{\tt applgrid}
to be able to account with the photon-initiated calculations provided
by {\tt MadGraph5\_aMC@NLO} significantly streamlines the inclusion
of future LHC measurements in QED PDF fits consistently including
diagrams with initial-state photons.

The results presented in this work are available upon
request in the {\tt LHAPDF6} format~\cite{Buckley:2014ana}.\\
