\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

The determination of the photon content of the proton has recently
attracted a considerable amount of attention, motivated by its
potentially large impact for precision physics at the LHC.
%
In this work, we have presented a determination of the photon PDF from
a fit based on HERA inclusive DIS structure functions together with
the recent ATLAS measurements of the high-mass Drell-Yan cross
sections obtained by means of the {\tt xFitter} framework.
%
We find that, as hinted by a previous reweighting analysis, the
high-mass DY data provides significant constraints on the photon PDF
in the region $0.05 \le x \le 0.3$, where the data has direct
sensitivity.
%
The resulting uncertainties on the gluon are still substantial,
between 20\%-40\%, though clearly smaller than those of the
NNPDF3.0QED analysis (based on older LHC Drell-Yan measurements).

Our results are in agreement within uncertainties with two recent
calculations of the photon PDF, LUXqed and HKR, in the region of $x$
where the DY data has sensitivity.
%
On the other hand, we also find that a direct determination of the
photon PDF is still far from being competitive with the LUXqed and HKR
calculations, which are based on precise measurements of the inclusive
structure functions of the proton.
%
This analysis however provides further evidence that the information
on the photon PDF provided by different experimental datasets is
overall consistent.

The results of this study have been made possible by a number of
technical developments that should be of direct application for future
PDF fits accounting for QED corrections.
%
These developments include in particular the implementation of full NLO
QCD+QCD corrections to the DGLAP evolution equations and the DIS
structure functions in {\tt APFEL}.
%
Moreover, our results further illustrate the flexibility of the {\tt
  xFitter} framework to extend its capabilities from the standard
quark and gluon PDF fits.
%
Finally, the extension of {\tt aMCfast} and {\tt APPLgrid} to allow
for the presence of photon-initiated channels in the calculations
provided by {\tt MadGraph5\_aMC@NLO}, significantly streamlines the
inclusion of future LHC measurements in PDF fits with QED corrections
consistently including diagrams with initial-state photons.
